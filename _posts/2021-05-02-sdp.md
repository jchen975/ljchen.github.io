In this post, I derive two equivalent formulations of a semidefinite program. 

_Acknowledgement: this problem appears as a homework question in Prof. Stark Draper's course, ECE1505 Convex Optimization, at the University of Toronto._

Semidefinite programs 
======
Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a specific type of \textit{conic form programs}, which is a subclass of convex optimization problems with respect to the [Lowener order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loewner_order), that is, the cone of (symmetric) positive semidefinite matrices denoted as \\(\mathbb{S}\_{+}^{n}\\). SDPs are typically formulated as 

$$ 
\begin{array}{cl}
    \text{minimize}{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} & {c}^{\mathsf{T}}x  \\\\
    \text{such that} & F\_0 + x\_1F\_1 + \cdots + x\_n F\_n \succeq \mathbf{0} \\\\ 
    & Gx = h
\end{array} 
$$

where \\(c \in \mathbb{R}^n\\), \\(G \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}\\), and each \\(F\_i\\) is an \\(m \times m\\) real symmetric matrix, denoted by \\(F_i \in \mathbb{S}^m\\). The inequality constraint is known as a _linear matrix inequality_ (LMI), which is a generalized inequality. Note that, while the decision variable in the SDP above is the vector \\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\\), they can often appear as bona fide matrices (and not necessarily symmetric matrices), e.g., for \\(i \in \\{1, \dots, N\\}\\), \\(A\_i, B\_i, C\_i\\) are constant matrices of size \\(n \times n, n \times n, n \times m\\), and \\(X \in \mathbb{S}^n_{++}\\) and \\(Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\\) are decision variables, then 

$$
F(X) \triangleq F_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^N A\_i X B\_i + B^{\mathsf{T}}\_i X A^{\mathsf{T}}\_i + C\_i Y + Y^{\mathsf{T}} C^{\mathsf{T}}\_i  \succeq \mathbf{0}
$$  

is a perfectly valid LMI.

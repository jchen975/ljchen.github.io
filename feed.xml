<h1 id="semidefinite-programs">Semidefinite programs</h1>
<p>Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a specific type of \textit{conic form programs}, which is a subclass of convex optimization problems with respect to generalized inequalities; specifically, the cone of (symmetric) positive semidefinite matrices denoted as $\mathbb{S}<em>{+}^{n}$. SDPs are typically formulated as 
\(\begin{array}{cl}
    \text{minimize}{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} &amp; {c}^{\mathsf{T}}x  \\
    \text{such that} &amp; F_0 + x_1F_1 + \cdots + x_nF_n \succeq \mathbf{0} \\ 
    &amp; Gx = h
\end{array}
\right.\)
where \(c \in \mathbb{R}^n\), \(G \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}\), and each \(F_i\) is an \(m \times m\) real symmetric matrix, denoted by \(F_i \in \mathbb{S}^m\). The inequality constraint is known as a _linear matrix inequality</em> (LMI), which is a generalized inequality. Note that, while the decision variable in the SDP above is the vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\), they can often appear as bona fide matrices (and not necessarily symmetric matrices), e.g., for \(i \in {1, \dots, N}\), \(A_i, B_i, C_i\) are constant matrices of size \(n \times n, n \times n, n \times m\), and \(X \in \mathbb{S}^n_{++}\) and \(Y \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\) are decision variables, then 
\(F(X) \triangleq F_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^N A_i X B_i + B_i^{\mathsf{T}} X A_i^{\mathsf{T}} + C_i Y + Y^{\mathsf{T}} C_i^{\mathsf{T}}  \succeq \mathbf{0}\)<br />
is a perfectly valid LMI.</p>]]></content><author><name>Liangjie (Jeffrey) Chen</name></author><category term="optimization" /><category term="coursework" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, I derive two equivalent formulations of a semidefinite program.]]></summary></entry></feed>

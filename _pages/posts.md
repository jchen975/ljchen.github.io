<!-- Note: The posts on this page include previous coursework notes, side projects from research, and other personal projects. As I have only informal mathematical training, and I intend for these notes to be more so for record-keeping than educational purposes, they will inevitably be not so rigorous, and may even contain mistakes. I welcome and appreciate any feedback, suggestion, and/or corrections in such cases.   -->
